<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>I am fascinated by technology. I always have been. Whether ogling futuristic tech in vintage dystopian thrillers, imagining the world as one big immersive code base prompted by The Matrix movies, or realizing the potential of technology enhanced humankind that emerges everyday in our world, technology is one of the most powerful, unpredictable, and impactful forces humankind has ever known.</p>

<p>I also love teaching and design. I have been an Instructional Designer since 2010, completed a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Instructional Design in 2014, and have experience with a wide array of technology, teaching, and design and development approaches. </p>

<p>My first interaction with code was through developing an HTML webpage from a book in the early 2000s. Naturally, it was hideous, but it was also amazing to know that I could ask the computer to make things from pixels. After that, I used HTML and simple markup in my design work, publications, and so on throughout the years.</p> 
<p>In 2019, after a decade in higher education teaching and practicing Instructional Design, I decided it was time to commit to learning code.</p>

<p>While I am a budding programmer, I am a very experienced Instructional Designer, speaker, author of numerous research publications, professor, course designer, and more. I am also the father of four amazing sons, and husband to the most amazing woman on the planet.</p>
